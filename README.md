# Purple Caster Minions Riot Games Data Visualization Project
Through using Riot Games' public API, I am investigating how to acquire individual game data of different characters going against each other in specific roles. Using this data, I am summarizing the data to provide character (champion) winrate in every lane in every specific matchup.

Due to limitations of API call requests, I am currently investigating how to continually extract data through a server to gain more entries. Hence, the data will have more values to increase reliability.

In the future, I hope to not extract data to a CSV file but put this through on a website to allow all end users access to these analytics. Hence, I am currently also investigating how to develop a website through Django.
